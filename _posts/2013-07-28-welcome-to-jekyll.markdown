# The Energy and Housing Program

The Energy and Housing Program is an initiative to address the problems of energy use by the resident in multifamily residential properties in New York City. It's our belief that by using new technologies, individual residents can gain more control of their energy use, thereby saving natural resources and money. This will include addressing electricity, heating, water and communications. Our initial focus will be to address electric energy issues in New York City and how smart grids and smart meter systems should help residents.

# Background

There are approximately 3 million housing units in NYC. These are mostly composed of rental, cooperatives, condominium, 1-3 family homes. Each residential unit has an energy budget that can include electricity, water, gas, oil and communication components. The water supply is a basic commodity and is under the control of New York City. The City has spent several decades upgrading an old system that had not been well maintained. The result has been the creation of a first class drinking water that is better than all bottled water. In addition, all residential buildings now have automated water meter reading systems that were installed to allow meter reading from the street.

The residential sector accounts for about 32% of New York City’s electricity consumption and more than 50% in all boroughs except Manhattan. NYC residents in the 3 million housing units should be able to able to actively participate in conservation and load management programs.

# NYC Policy

New York City has clearly stated its policy goals in the PLANYC 2030 energy policy statements regarding electric use:

1. “We will seek to cut (electric) peak load by 25% through increased enrollment in peak load management programs and real time pricing, reducing our daily energy usage is critical to achieving our 30% carbon reduction goal and saving money on energy across the city.”

2. “We will increase the impact of our energy efficiency efforts through a coordinated energy education, awareness, and training campaign.”

3. The City set as a goal of the conversion of 50% of residents to a Variable Pricing system such as the Day Ahead Market (DAM) by 2013

The Energy and Housing Programs Initial Efforts

Our initial effort is to focus on electricity and examine how NYC residents can use new technology, including smart meter systems and possible new regulatory market mechanisms, to actively understand and manage their electric use. They may wish to do this individually or participate in various forms of aggregation.

# Policy Priorities

Conduct research, sponsor symposia and assist in the education of the public focusing on the following issues:

1.  The technologies to allow residents to understand and control their electric use are in a state of active development. Smart meter systems are evolving rapidly and offer the best chance of success. However, their usability by housing residents needs to be improved.

2.  NYC and PSC law / regulations are not finalized on what kinds of smart meter systems are best applicable in NYC, and on the kinds of regulations that would allow active participation by residents and originations representing residents such as cooperatives, ESCOs, rental properties, and other categories.

3.  Incentives to accelerate this process are fragmented and/or not “tested”. There are many partial efforts including subsidies, tax credits, tax abatements, sale of savings and the possible use of the DHCR MCI program, or the creation of an a “energy” program similar to the NYC J-51 program.
